## EXPERIENCE

---

### Chinese Academy of Sciences (Intern)

Chongqing, China

Research Assistant Intern      (May 2018 - Dec 2018)

* Studied the recommender system and related theories of latent factor. Proposed the elastic-net-regularized LFA-based models, which were able to regularize the LF distribution and improved the generality. And published “Elastic-net Regularized Latent Factor Analysis-based Models for Recommender Systems” on Neurocomputing, Oct. 2018
  
* Conducted Research to investigate the processing of EEG signal noise and interference, summarized the popular algorithms of feature extraction and classification.

### NIO (Intern)

Shanghai, China

Software Development Engineer Intern (May 2019 - August 2019)

* Based on the vehicle's driving, charging data, generate a real-time updated Hive database via Oozie pipeline by using Apache Spark.
* According to the road network data provided by OpenStreetMap and GPS location data received from the vehicle, predict the actual vehicle location and match with corresponding road labels.

## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

---

Carnegie Mellon University

* Predicted movie review scores by implementing Logistic Regression. With given dataset, achieved 98.6% of training accuracy and 90.25% testing accuracy.
* Predicted political parties by implementing Decision Tree with ID3 algorithm, a 85% accuracy was achieved on test set.
* Using a subset of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) dataset, implemented Neural Network algorithm to label images of handwritten letters, achieved 100% accuracy with 20 hidden units and 100 epochs.
* By giving large datasets of correctly and incorrectly spelled vocabulary lists, implemented Levenshtein Edit-Distance algorithm to find the least edit distance and return the corresponding correct words efficiently.
* Using a dataset of speech from political parties, implemented Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the political party for test dataset, achieved 96% accuracy on test set.
* Implemented a cache simulator by using C program, it performs the hit/miss/evict behavior in the process of hardware cache and memory read and write. And wrote a matrix transpose function for cache performance optimization to improve the efficiency by using as few clock cycles as possible.
* Wrote a simple Linux shell, it supports simple job control, including foreground process, background process and processing child process and parent process, it also provides I/O redirection function* Wrote a storage allocator, in particular implementations of the malloc, free, and realloc functions. Different allocation methods are implemented with the emphasis on space utilization and throughput respectively.
