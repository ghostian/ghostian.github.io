My name is Junxiao(Robert) Guo.

I completed my Master degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (focused on Artificial Intelligence). I have an undergraduate degree in Physics from Drexel University and previous experience as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. And I took taking my internship at NIO as a software engineer. Currently I am working at HuaWei as an algorithm engineer.
