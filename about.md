Hello, My name is Junxiao Guo.

I'm pursuing my Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and plan to leverage my coursework and professional experience in the machine learning and natural language processing. I have an undergraduate degree in Physics from Drexel University and previous experience as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. And I took taking my internship at NIO as a software engineer. By the end of 2020, I will be joining HuaWei as software engineer.
