The idea and example of BitMap Algorithm

## What is BitMap Algorithm

BitMap is an algorithm to use one bit (8 bit = 1 byte) to tag the value of the corresponding element, which is the key. Because the data is stored by bit unit, it can significantlly save storage spcae.

On 32-bit machine, for example, an interger value `int a`, take 32 bits in memory,  we can use the 32 bits to represent 0-31 in the decimal system, bitmap algorithm uses this advantage to handle the sort and query of large dataset

## Advantages

* High efficiency, no need of comparison and bit shift
* Low memory useage, because integer type occupies 32bits, if the sotred numbers are continuous numbers, it can save at most 32 times of space. Such as N=10000000, it only need N/8 = 312500 Bytes = 305K of space, if we use int arrays to store the data, it will need more than 38M of space

## Disadvantages

* Can not perform sort adn query for data if there are duplicate elements.
* Can not save space efficiently if the numbers are not consecutive, or the gap between numbers are big.

## Example

Request a integer type memory space (4 Byte, 32 bit), when we entering 4, 2, 1,3:

Insert 4:

> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`1` 0000

Insert 2:

> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`1` 0`1`00

Insert 1:

> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`1` 0`11`0

Insert 3:

> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`1` `111`0

The idea is simple, the key is decimal and binary bit need a mapping talbe, to map the decimal number to bit positions. When we query if the number exists we onnly need to check if the number is 0 or 1 at the corresponding bit position.

Compare to Bloom-Filter Algorithm, if the interval between numbers is relatively big, and can tolerate small amount of mistakes, Bloom-Filter is a better algorithm, bacasue the length of arry in BitMap is decided by the maxim
