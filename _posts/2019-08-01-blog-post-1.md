Some of most usful linux commands

Log
------------------

If we have a log file `foo.log`:

Some of the most frequently used commands are:

* `cat foo.log`
* `tail -f foo.log`
* `vim foo.log`

If we want to find some record from the file by using `vim`:

* `vim foo.log`
* Press `G` jump to the end of the file
* Press `?` + keyword to search the corresponding record
* Press `n` to search from bottom to top, `N` to search from top to bottom

* `tail -f foo.log` can check if there is any change of the log file.

For large files, it's better to use `grep`. If we want to check a user's log file by searching the user's ID, we can use:

* `cat foo.log | grep <UserID>`

Then we can find all the records containing `UserID` from the file.

If we want to find the line number of the info, we can add `-n` parameter, which the previous command line becomes `cat -n foo.log | grep <UserID>`

If we want to check lines before and after for the current line:

* `sed -n "1888,1888p" foo.log`: start search from line 1888 and end the serach at the end of line 1888

* `cat -n foo.log | tail -n +1888 | head -n 50`: start from line 1888 and push foward 20 lines.

If we do not have an exact query word, we can use `more` to browse or output to an file:

* `cat foo.log | grep <keyword> | more`
* `cat foo.log | grep <keyword> &gt; /home/ghostian/tmpfiles/output.txt`

Sometimes if we want to cauculate how many lines does the log file have, we can use:

* `cat foo.log | wc -l`

Process and Prot
----

There are two commands to see the current process:

* `ps -ef`
* `ps aux`

By using `|` pipeline and `grep` to filter out the process we need, for example:

* `ps -ef | grep java`

If we want to kill the procee, we can use:

* `kill -9 <ProcessID>`

To check the port, we can use `netstat -lntup`

To find the information of a specific port: `lsof -i:<port>`

System Status

`top` to view process stat in real time
