In order to only sort one column without changing others in pandas, we need to break an internal Pandas security mechanism - aligning by index, which takes care of the data consistency. So assigning 1D `Numpy` array or a vanilla Python list would do the trick, because both of them don't have an index, so Pandas can't do alignment:

```python
df['B'] = df['B'].sort_values(ascending=False).values
```

or

```python
df['B'] = df['B'].sort_values(ascending=False).tolist()
```
